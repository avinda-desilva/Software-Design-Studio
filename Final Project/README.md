# FinalProject
Welcome to the CS 126 Final Project. This is a top down 2D car game that I created. It uses openframeworks and c++ code for this game to be created. In order for the game to played, all the files from the src file should downloaded. The finalproject release is what includes the make file in order for the game to run. Enjoy!
