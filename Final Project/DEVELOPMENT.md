# Development
## Week 1 (11/11 - 11/17)
* Created Idea For a 3d game that involved revolving around a sphere
* Realized that using the camera to rotate around a 3d environment would not be an easy task.
* It was not easy creating the physics of driving a car. When turning the car, it rotates at an unusual angle and velocity. 
* Images cannot easily rotate around a certain point.
## Week 2 (11/25 - 12/1)
* Learned about Push and PopMatrix which allows to rotate the pixels for a certain section of the code.
* Implemented a different approach for the car physics and this version seems to work better. However it only registers  one key press so the car does not turn or accelerate at the same time.
## Week 3 (12/2 - 12/8)
*  Created the item class which should randomly place an item within the game field. However, the star does not appear within the circle and usually appears in a random spot.
*  Also cannot figure out a good way to detect if the player is within the circle. Because there is no function that checks if two points are intersecting with a circle. 
## Week 4 (12/9 - 12/15)
* Used the distance formula to figure out collision detection with the game_field. 
* Also created obstacle class which uses the same logic as the item class for placement within the field.
* Created a timer bar that changes in size as the time begins to decrease.
