# Proposal
For my CS 126 final project, my application idea was to make a 2d GUI game. The target of the game will be to collect the star (checkpoint) within a certain time limit. The plan is to make the time limit 5 seconds. If the player is not able to collect the star within the time limit, that will be the end of the game. The window will consist of a 2d circle which will be the gamefield. As the player continues to collect the stars, the circle will increase in size. The stars will be placed randomly within the circle. Additionally, as the player's score increases,obstacles (rectangles)  will begin to appear that the player can run into, making it harder as the game continues. To complete this task I will be using the ofGraphics library. The shapes can be drawn with different functions like drawRectangle, drawCircle etc. I will also be using the image class in order to show the icons. In order to make the car simulation, I will be using online resources in order to understand the forces when driving a car. 

Another thing I will have to look into is collision detection and figuring out how to represent bumping into another object when driving. I have found online resources from ofBook to learn more about these libraries. Furthermore, I have created simple games in Java so hopefully this will help me create this 2d game with OpenFrameworks and c++
